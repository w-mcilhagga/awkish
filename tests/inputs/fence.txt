### Print all lines

```python
from awkish import Awk

# 1. create the awk object
awk = Awk()

# 2. define conditions and actions
@awk.when(True)
def doline(line):
    print(line)

# 3. run it on a file
awk('filename.txt')
```

The condition decorator `@awk.when(True)` indicates that the decorated action should be called for every line.

The action function `doline` is declared with a parameter `line` which is filled in with
the entire contents of the line each time it is called.
